# project-3-turnin

Proposal:

This project will examine sentiment towards the candidates of the Nevada 2020 Caucus. We will be scraping Twitter in order to gather data, which will then be fed into our Machine Learning model. Once the data is processed, it will be displayed on an interactive website displaying sentiment statistics and a random selection of positive and negative tweets for each candidate.
